# mercury logo #

> Experimenting with fonts in one of proposed logos for mercury.

1. The original proposal.
2. Using the [Equity B][2] font.
3. Using the [Concourse T3][3] font.
4. Using the [Fira Sans][4] font.

This is just the first draft. I didn't play with size, position, italics, color, etc.

Those aspects will need to be addressed if one of alternatives proves to be interesting.

Equity and Concourse are commercial fonts, I've got a license to use them. Fira Sans is open-source.

See [the pull request #98][1] for discussion and more alternative designs.
